# Friends-List-Application-Using-Express-Server-with-JWT

-Used an Express Server to create API endpoints and carried out CRUD operations on temporary data. Using JWT and session authentication, I have limited these activities to users who have authenticated for this project.

-Email serves as the key and friends object serves as the value in this case. The friends object is a JSON/dictionary. A dictionary containing firstName, lastName, and DOB mapped to their corresponding values is the friends object. The HTTP request's "body" was used in place of the words "query" and "params." All CRUD actions will only be accessible to authenticated users.

-Used Postman to test the endpoints' output.
